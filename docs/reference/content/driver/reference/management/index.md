## Management

The driver provides two mechanisms for examining its state:

- [Logging]({{< relref "driver/reference/management/logging.md" >}}): Comprehensive logging of all operations using [SLF4J](http://www.slf4j.org/)
- [Monitoring]({{< relref "driver/reference/management/monitoring.md" >}}): Built on [JMX](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/jmx/)
