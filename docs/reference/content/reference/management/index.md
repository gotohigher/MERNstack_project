## Management

The driver provides two mechanisms for examining its state:

- [Logging]({{< relref "reference/management/logging.md" >}}): Comprehensive logging of all operations.
- [Application Performance Monitoring]({{< relref "reference/management/apm.md" >}}): The Application Performance Monitoring API is an API that allows developers to tap into the commands issued to MongoDB to record performance metrics and/or inspect the commands sent to MongoDB.
