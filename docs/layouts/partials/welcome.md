## What is Node.js Native?

Node.js Native is the MongoDB official Node.js driver allowing you to use MongoDB in your applications.

## What does Node.js Native do?

The Node.js driver handles the connections to a single MongoDB server, a replicaset or a set of Mongos proxies in a sharded system. It lets your application interact with the server and lets it perform operations against the database.
