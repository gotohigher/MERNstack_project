Timestamp()
===========

------------------
Constructor
------------------


Defines a Timestamp class for representing a 64-bit two's-complement
integer value, which faithfully simulates the behavior of a Java "Timestamp". This
implementation is derived from TimestampLib in GWT.


  .. js:class:: Timestamp()

   :param number low: the low (signed) 32 bits of the Timestamp.
   :param number high: the high (signed) 32 bits of the Timestamp.


Constructs a 64-bit two's-complement integer, given its low and high 32-bit
values as *signed* integers.  See the from* functions below for more
convenient ways of constructing Timestamps.



The internal representation of a Timestamp is the two given signed, 32-bit values.
We use 32-bit pieces because these are the size of integers on which
Javascript performs bit-operations.  For operations like addition and
multiplication, we split each number into 16-bit pieces, which can easily be
multiplied within Javascript's floating-point representation without overflow
or change in sign.



In the algorithms below, we frequently reduce the negative case to the
positive case by negating the input(s) and then post-processing the result.
Note that we must ALWAYS check specially whether those values are MIN_VALUE
(-2^63) because -MIN_VALUE == MIN_VALUE (since 2^63 cannot be represented as
a positive number, it overflows back into a negative).  Not handling this
case would often result in infinite recursion.
